"""One bounded tool-use loop, run four times with different equipment.

M2 was a single loop holding pricing, supply, policy and logistics at once. It
worked and it was fragile in a specific way: the model spent turns re-reading its
own transcript, and when one part went wrong the whole run went wrong with it.

A `Specialist` is that loop with the scope narrowed — a tool subset, a system
prompt about one job, a typed report, and its own budget. The narrowing is the
point. A specialist that runs out of budget takes its own question down and
nothing else, and the supervisor is told which question that was.

Everything the earlier milestones added still applies here, in one place instead
of four: tool results arrive inside an evidence envelope (M4), a scope denial
ends the run (M5), and a reported figure has to appear in the call it cites (M2).
