"""M3: answer a policy question from the Atlas corpus, and prove the answer is in it.

This is the M2 mechanism applied to text instead of numbers. In M2, a figure had
to appear in the tool result it cited. Here, a claim has to appear in the chunk
it cites. The model must return the exact text, word for word, so the check is a
substring test and not a judgement.

The word-for-word requirement is the important part. If you ask a model which
chunk a claim came from, it returns a confident id and a paraphrase. If you ask
it to quote the sentence, and then check that the sentence is in the chunk, you
can tell the two apart.
